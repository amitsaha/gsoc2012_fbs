Roadmap
=======

This project was initiated as part of the **Google Summer of Code'2012**
by *Amit Saha*, mentored by *Tim Flink*. 

As of August 13, 2012 - five days away from the project deadline, the
service is running on a local infrastructure of multiple workers on
different archs and this documentation describes the performance on
this infrastructure.

The primary goal of the project was to make it useable by the Fedora
QA and that is what we shall be looking at beyond the project
deadline. Deployment on Fedora infrastructure is the next major goal.
