Welcome to Fedora Build Service's documentation!
==========================================================

**On-Demand Fedora Build service** seeks to build Live and installation images
for developers, testers and consumers of Fedora Linux. During the
testing of Fedora releases, test images are often useful as smoke
tests before full TC/RC composes, as baselines for specific test days
or for automated installation testing in AutoQA. The idea is to make
an on-demand build service which users/developers can use to
make custom Fedora based distributions so that command-line wrangling
can be minimized.
