During the testing of Fedora releases, test images are often useful as smoke tests before full TC/RC composes, as baselines for specific test days or for automated installation testing in AutoQA. The idea is to make an on-demand build service which users/developers can use to make custom Fedora based distributions so that command-line wrangling can be minimized.\r\n\r\nThe project documentation is available [here](http://on-demand-fedora-build-service.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","name":"On-Demand Fedora Build Service","google":"","tagline":"Minimize Command Line Wrangling"}
